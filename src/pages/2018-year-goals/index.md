As the year comes to an end, it's time to look back at the events and improve upon it. 2018 has been a roller-coaster with a lot of new experiences. I have learnt so many things, development to design and more.

The biggest one was moving from React ecosystem to Angular for my fulltime job. And yes, I switch my job this year and I couldn't be happier. (**Off-the-record**: I work at [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com) - an Edtech startup.)

> **Starting Angular?** Create a basic Angular CLI project and build something. You will learn more from it than from the docs.

I also had a lot of learning in terms of improving the design of UI elements, but since it's a continuous process, it will definitely continue over to the next year. Another great experience that I had was working in China for a month. It was a completely different world, and I also did manage to make some good friends there.

Apart from these, I switched to Mac from Windows, tired my hands on starting a podcast and video series, launched a couple of personal projects, etc.

**Setbacks?** Yes, there are, and some learning from them too. I got selected as a speaker at React Rally, but was not able to make it due to visa issues.

So as we end 2018, I would like to <mark>thank everyone who supported and inspired me</mark> to achieve all the above things.

### What does this mean for 2019?

The bars are definitely high! But that shouldn't stop anyone from dreaming big 😉. I have so much stuff in my todos that needs my attention and so I am looking at planning it accordingly.

##### Major Goals

 - 🚀 Increase **open source** contribution
 - 👨🏻‍💻 Learn and use **GraphQL** on the server
 - ✍🏻 Write at least one **blog** post a month
 - 📹 Create more **videos** with live coding screen shares
 - 📚 Learn **Python**(Django)
 - 🛫 Plan at least one **trip** with family and one with friends
 - 🗣 **Speak** at a conference
 - 💪🏻 **Workout** regularly

These are not a new year resolution but a goal that I'm committing publicly to achieve. I'm also looking at being active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apvarun) to learn and support the awesome web dev community there.

### Wrapping up

Kudos to you for reaching the end. Let's make 2019 more fruitful to oneself and to the web community 🥳. Keep learning, respect and help others and stay motivated!

Happy 🎊 2019 🎊!
