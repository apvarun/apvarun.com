title: 'Stop reinventing the wheel'

excerpt: 'One of the important things I learnt in 2019 as a developer is to not reinvent the wheel. Develop only the things that are completely custom solutions.'

As any other year, 2019 was also a big package of challenges, learnings, fun and new friendships. The year gave me a lot of new stuff to get excited about. Although I wasn't completely able to achieve my [goals](https://apvarun.com/blog/2019-year-goals) for the year, I was able to get to some of them. And also had some unexpected ones making into the list.

// Logging

‚úÖ GraphQL on Server & Client Ôºç Got a chance to experiment with Python/Graphene server and Apollo Client / React Apollo on a side-project

‚úÖ Trips Ôºç Three New Countries (Indonesia, Netherlands, Germany)

üüß Open Source Ôºç Created a couple of new projects, not much contributions to existing ones
(My Fav. Ôºç [React Onboarding Pro](https://github.com/apvarun/react-onboarding-pro))

üåü Moved to Amsterdam

## But I want to talk about something else today!

None of this gave me my biggest learning of the year. As a developer, I always used to be inclined towards building stuff. And if I wanted to setup something online, traditionally, I'd build it myself.

This mindset has given me a lot of knowledge in my field. I had been able to try and explore many things on Frontend, which one might not try in a day job.

But there was an area which I never explored.

## Current Saas ecosystem

> In 2019 and moving forward, there is no need for you to build each and every feature. You can easily integrate a couple of tools and get stuff working.

### Let me give an example.

Have your ever bought a web server and spent time figuring out the initial setup for that?
Checkout [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a Saas product that aims to simplify webapp deployments. Connect your git repo, specify the build process/command, and you are done. You get a web frontend with highly performant infrastructure bundled with a top-notch CDN.

Selling stuff online? You no longer need to deal with payments or data management/privacy. [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) can host your content and provide you with stripe integration for collecting payments.

## It's all about time to market!

Like the above examples, the No-Code or the Low-Code movement is also picking up traction as there are businesses that completely run on no-code tools and make thousands of dollars each month.

<em>List of some of the popular no-code tools</em>

[Ben's](https://twitter.com/bentossell) Makerpad has an awesome list of tools which can help anyone build rich experiences in a couple of hours. Such tools open up doors for a whole new set of people to build internet businesses. Checkout the tools here: [Makerpad](https://www.makerpad.co/marketplace)

Btw, Makerpad itself is built on top of No-Code and few months back, he announced the Seed funding for the same on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1169316976466022400?s=21). This is massive üî•.

The industry is growing so fast that a no-code course platform [No-Code MVP](https://nocodemvp.com/) has reported \$9.1K MRR.

While writing about these, I should also mention Micro-saas tools, that aim to solve problems/achieve tasks in a very specific niche.

### You still want to code? üòÖ

Of course! I can relate to that.

But, I strongly believe that using some of these tools can reduce the effort for building something big and can help you launch much faster.

In 2019, I explored a bunch of the above tools and was able to setup various automation workflows. I had built tools for web scraping, automated email triggers, etc. And as a developer, I did build webapps around them as well.

In the process, I realized that its much faster to build and launch stuff if I'm able to combine both of these workflows effectively.

I hope that this post has given you an insight into the shift in the way software is built. Catch me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apvarun) if you like to chat about this more.
